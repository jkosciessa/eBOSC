# eBOSC: extended Better OSCillation Detection method and simulation scripts

This releases accompanies the manuscript "Single-trial characterization of neural rhythms: potentials and challenges" (see below for full reference).

--------- License information -----------

extended BOSC (eBOSC) is an extension of the BOSC library and therefore employs scripts that are based on the original toolbox. These functions are included in the 'external' folder of the current package.

--------- Simulation files -----------

The scripts producing the simulation files as well as the relevant supplementary plots in the paper can be found in the subdirectory 'simulations'. Note that only the scripts are provided and the paths still need to be adjusted. This is currently still work-in-progress.
